## Project Description
The Student Enrollment Form is a web-based application developed using HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, and JsonPowerDB.  
The application is designed to store, retrieve, and update student enrollment records using Roll Number as the primary key.

The form dynamically interacts with the database to determine whether a student record already exists. Based on this check, the application enables either the Save or Update functionality while ensuring proper validation and data integrity.
